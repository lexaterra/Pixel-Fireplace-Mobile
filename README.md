# Pixel-Fireplace-Mobile
A Pixel Fireplace for Android, Firestick, and GoogleTV


https://youtu.be/4AzJNPXveT0?



I've created this minimal pixel fireplace for Android. It's 100% free. I did all the coding and used android studio to package the app. It's not a video or animated gif. It was designed using the popular "Doom Fire" algorithm. It also works with Amazon Firestick and Google Tv!

Sound Shortcuts:

Android: Press anywhere on screen to turn sound on/off.

Firestick/GoogleTv: Arrow Up to turn sound on/off

Background Color Shortcuts:

Android: 2 Finger press for black/white

Firestick/GoogleTv: Arrow Down for black/white


I hope you guys find it useful!
